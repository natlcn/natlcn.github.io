                <h2> Greetings! üëãüèº </h2>
                <p>  My name is Nathalie, I was born August 2, 2005 and I come from a loving family who supported me wholeheartedly and have constantly pushed me to be the better version of myself.
                    We originated from the Philippines and at the age of 11, I came to Canada along with my father and brother.
                    With the help of my uncle and my mother who had been here longer than us, my entire family packed their bags and migrated to Canada. I myself enjoy nature, especially the fall season.
                    I admire the beauty of the gloomy afternoons, crisp cold breeze as you walk across a field full of vibrant fallen leaves. The feeling of cold weather while being warm under your
                    baggy clothes and Christmas right around the corner.
                </p>
                <h3> Now.. </h3>
                <p> I am now 19 years old and currently majoring in UX interactive design course. I have a 4 year old orange cat named Ollie that my family and I love dearly!
                    My favorite sport is volleyball and badminton, as well as I enjoy playing competitive video games. I often play shooter FPS games with friends, but I also
                    enjoy calm simulations and narrative adventure games. I am focusing on trying to further improve my coding skills and so far I am finding it fun!
                </p>

                <h1> Lifestyle </h1>
                <p> My days consist of job, school, and friends/family. I try to balance all three of those aspects of my life the best that I can, but I do lack some aspects when school courses get too heavy.
                    I work at the YYC airport and am a hostess/server in the WestJet Elevation Lounge. In my free time, I often hangout with my older brother, or my friends.  </p>
                <h3> School </h3>
                <p> I am currently attending the Southern Alberta Institute of Technologies (SAIT) and taking a 2-year diploma course.  </p>
